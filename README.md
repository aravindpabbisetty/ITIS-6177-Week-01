### Project Title:- 
#### Video Call Application(WebRTC) with audio driven talking head generation.
### Introduction:-
#### The project is centred around a video call, where we capture the audio of the caller(sender) and transmit over to the receiver where the face of the caller is transitioned to the animated character or a hero.While the audio of the caller remains the same.The key benefits of above transition are as follows:the privacy of the callers is protected as we are changing the face of callers to well-know characters.Thereby, the identity of users can be withheld with utmost security. Secondly, the disturbances that occur due to poor network connection can be avoided as we are transmitting only audio.This is because audio transmission requires less bandwidth when compared video transmission.
### Architecture:-
#### We are planning to build a web application so we will be using Client-Server Architecture.
